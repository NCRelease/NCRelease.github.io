<h1>Beta Release</h1>
<p>
Beta-3 of the new experimental netCle interface is available for download.
</p>
<a class="download" href="netCleSimpleb3.jar" download>netCleSimpleb3.jar</a>
<p>
This version contains a number of improvements:
<ul>
<li>A Keyboard option which will not work in bluetooth mode.  All of the UI issues with having a non-bluetooth option have been dealt with (I think).</li>
<li>Checks are made for port over-use.  e.g. if you try to configure a joystick and a button into the same port it will not let you download.</li>
<li>You can assign two single buttons to one port.  One will be assigned to the A sensor and one to the B sensor automatically.</li>
<li>The logic for netCle connection and disconnection has been cleaned up so users do not get unnecessary dialog boxes.</li>
<li>Yih Lerh's head tilt to turn the gyro on and off has been added as an option.
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if you create a Gyro solution there is a new "Calibrate" button.  Press it and you will be taken through a series of dialogs which try
to gather the data needed to determine what the threshold settings should be.  However, it currently doesn't change any settings.  I have so far
determined, in some detail, two ways to approach this which will <b>not</b> work.  It will take some thinking and experimentation to come up with something
that does work.
