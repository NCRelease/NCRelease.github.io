<h1>Versioning</h1>
<p>
The version numbering scheme for netCl&eacute has been somewhat confusing and chaotic in the past.  
Different and unrelated version numbers were used for the release number, the configuration software and the hub firmware.
</p>

<p>
As of the latest release (Version 2.04 - August 22, 2020) this is changing.  This release consists of
the following components:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Hub firmware for the Gen-1 hub (Version 1.04)</li>
<li>Hub firmware for the Gen-2 hub (Version 2.04)</li>
<li>The Java configuration utility (Version 1.04)</li>
</ul>
<p>
The version number for the configuration software and the Gen-1 firmware both start with '1'.  The version number for the release as a whole and for the Gen-2 firmware both start with '2'.  The numbers after the dot (the minor version number) are the same for all components.
</p>
<p>
This will be true in the future.  All components which are fully compatible with each other
will have the same minor version number.  If the software components you are using (hub firmware and configuration software) have the same minor version number 
then they will have a matching understanding of hub capabilities and hub-config communications. 
Other combinations are possible but may not provide full functionality. See the <a href="Compatibility.html">compatibility page</a> for details.
</p>

<h2>Beta Versions</h2>
<p>
From time to time beta versions of new software will be released, for testing and comment by 
team members.  All beta version numbers will end with a 'b' followed by a build number.
(Note: prior to release 2.04 there was no build number.)
</p>

<p>
As with releases, the minor version number will change whenever there is a change which would affect 
the communication between the configuration utility and the hub.  If the change is an isolated bug fix,
or a user interface change for the configuration the minor version number will not change - but the
build number <i>for the changed component</i> will be incremented.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The format of a version number is &ltmajor number&gt.&ltminor number&gtb&ltbeta-build number&gt
</p>
<ul><li>
For the moment the major number for the configuration software and for Gen-1 firmware is '1'.
The major number for Gen-2 firmware is '2'. 
</li>
<li>
Components which are fully compatible with each other will have the same minor version
number. This will match the minor version number for the release.
</li>
<li>
The 'b' and build number are used for beta releases only.  The build number will be incremented
with each change to a component.  Since components may be updated individually (there will often
be changes to the configuration software without any changes to firmware) the build numbers
for corresponding components will not necessarily match.  You can always visit the 
<a href="beta.html">Latest Beta</a> page to see if you have the most recent stuff.
